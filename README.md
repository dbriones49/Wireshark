# Wireshark


## Introduction
Wireshark is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer that allows users to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time. By capturing packets as they travel across a network, Wireshark can provide valuable insights into the behavior of network applications and devices. From a cyber security perspective, Wireshark can be used to detect and investigate security incidents, identify malicious activity, and troubleshoot network performance issues. For security purposes, the I.P address of the destinations and sources in the lab have been omitted. 



# Basic Filters
Using Wireshark to filter for unsecured protocols is simple for users as they can easily apply filters such as "http" or "ftp" to quickly identify unencrypted traffic. This allows SOC analysts to pinpoint potential security vulnerabilities and threats within the network, enabling them to take appropriate action to mitigate risks and protect sensitive data.

# Statistics Filter
Using the Statistics menue allows you to filter from a variety of options, including endpoints and packet length. Here I used a filter for protocol.
